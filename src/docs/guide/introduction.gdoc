This plugin adds an annotation on Enums to easy add and implement the MessageSourceResolvable interface. It was heavily inspired by this blog-entry by Rob Fletcher: ][http://adhockery.blogspot.dk/2009/03/internationalizing-domain-classes-and.html]

h2. If you use it, let me know

h2. Changes
h3. v1.0.7
Files to be pre-compiled moved from groovy-ast to groovy, that way Intellij Idea can find them when parsing the project for completions.

h3. v1.0.5, v1.0.6
Updating plugin descriptor, documentation and build dependencies

h3. v1.0.4
Documentation now on GitHub pages instead of grails.org

h3. v1.0.3
Plugin now runs under Grails 2.4.x
It is no longer a binary plugin. It should compile before all other classes.

h3. v1.0.2
The plugin is now released as a binary plugin due to AST transformations not being applied to inlined plugins.

h3. v1.0.1
Grails event hook to precompile AST transformations before the rest of the Grails compile phase. This is needed
so that enums annotated will be compiled correctly.

h3. v1.0.0
The plugin was formerly known as *EnumMessageSourceResolvable*, but was renamed to I18nEnums for easier reading and writing. Functionality wise it has not changed from v1.0.0 of EnumMessageSourceResolvable.

Now support configuration in Config.groovy - see documentation below
